#### 1. What is a distributed system?
Distributed system이란 무엇인가?

Definition
A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements
that appears to its users as a single coherent system.
Characteristic features
► Autonomous computing elements, also referred to as nodes, be
they hardware devices or software processes.
► Single coherent system: users or applications perceive a single
system ⇒ nodes need to collaborate.
